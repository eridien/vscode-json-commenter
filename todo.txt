Write code that scans json text one char at a time.
Keep track of the syntax using state variables.
Build an array of all ranges of white space where a new key value pair could be inserted while keeping the entire Json text valid

instead of looking for ranges of white space look for character postions where a new key/pair could be inserted while keeping the text valid json

in newPos get the Pos from the var pos and write it to the channel and store in in positions array
