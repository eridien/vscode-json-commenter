  highlight dark theme
  if click outside of currently editing document stop editing
  if click in currently editing document do nothing
  checking block on every click requires lineAt which is slow
    keep track of blocks
    get blocks on page load and every edit above last block
       use bookmark logic 
       use getText not lineAt
  problem: blocks can have different char positions
    fixed id width  -- 10 bits
    fixed type width -- 4 bits
    re-use old ids?
  add version -- 2 bits 
    can expand later via sub-field
  set editor.unicodeHighlight.invisibleCharacters
